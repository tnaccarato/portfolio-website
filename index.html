        <h2>HyperionDev</h2>
        <p>I am currently doing the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp
            which has so far included the following projects in Python:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Capstone I - Variables and Control Structures</strong></li>
            <p> This project entailed creating a program that allows a user to
                calculate their interest on an investment or to calculate the
                amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month. It
                included designing a user-friendly menu that allowed the user to
                pick between the two functions, using if else statements to ask
                for different information depending on the response chosen.
                Finally an easy to read response was generated containing all
                the information input.</p>

            <li><strong>Capstone II - Files</strong></li>
            <p> The aim of this project was to create a task manager for a small
                company, demonstrating working with files and string manipulation.
                The program had to read a text file containing tasks for the
                company as well as another text file containing user login
                information. If the user entered an incorrect password or
                username (i.e one that wasn't in the users text file), they
                were allowed to retry until they provided appropriate
                credentials. After a successful log in, a menu was displayed
                that allowed a user to add a task if they were admin
                (append it to tasks text file), view all tasks or view their
                own tasks (only show tasks with their username) in a
                user-friendly manner. In addition, admin could display
                statistics that showed the total number of tasks and users.</p>

            <li><strong>Capstone III - Lists, Functions, and String Handling</strong></li>
            <p>For this project, I had to edit the previous task to demonstrate
                the use of functions for each task in the program. In addition
                to this, I needed to ensure that duplicates could not be added
                to the users list and allow a user to view a particular task and
                either mark it as complete or edit the task. I also added
                another feature to the admin's menu which allowed them to
                generate reports that showed how many tasks have been completed
                by each user, as well as how many tasks were overdue and
                uncompleted, based on data in the text files.</p>

            <li><strong>Capstone IV - Object-Oriented Programming</strong></li>
            <p>As the final project of the first level of the bootcamp, I had to
                create an inventory wizard for a Nike warehouse.
                This used all the skills I had learnt so far, in addition to
                error handling and OOP, to create objects with a new Shoe class
                and perform various functions on them such as restock the shoe
                with the lowest quantity or search for a particular shoe by ID,
                all in an easy to read menu in a while loop.
            </p>
        </ol>
